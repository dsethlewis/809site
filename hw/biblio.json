  {"id":"feldman04","abstract":"The number one problem with abstracts is too much approach, not enough arrival. Sometimes abstracts are so generically written that they do not pique the reviewers’ interest at all. Many read like this: “Topic A is increasingly important in the global marketplace. Drawing upon the literatures in B, C, D, and E, we present a general framework for understanding A. Data were collected from a wide variety of ﬁrms and several interesting patterns of ﬁndings emerged. The article concludes with a discussion of future research directions and implications for management practice.” Abstracts are your ﬁrst chance to make a positive impression on reviewers; try to give the readers some concrete information to get them excited about your work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Feldman","given":"Daniel C."}],"container-title":"Journal of Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jm.2003.09.001","ISSN":"0149-2063, 1557-1211","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Devil is in the Details: Converting Good Research into Publishable Articles","title-short":"The Devil is in the Details","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1016/j.jm.2003.09.001","volume":"30"},
